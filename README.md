# Text-To-Speech-Converter
The Text-to-Speech Converter is a Python application that allows users to convert written text into spoken audio. Leveraging the power of the gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) library, this tool provides an easy-to-use interface for generating speech from text in various languages. Users can input any text, and the application will produce a high-quality audio file, which can be played back or saved for future use. This project is ideal for creating voiceovers, assisting individuals with visual impairments, or enhancing educational materials.
